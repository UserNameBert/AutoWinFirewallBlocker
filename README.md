A quick windows firewall blocker, simply checks the 4625 logs for 'X' failed logon attempts in 'x' amount of time and then adds them to the firewall deny/block list. 
Currently only handles IPv4.
**I'm not a programmer, dont expect updates, or for it to work without errors. Once installed, needs to run as admin.**
